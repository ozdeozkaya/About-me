Hi, I’m Ozde and I am an economics PhD student at NYU. My research fields are labor economics and applied microeconomics with special interests in education, health and gender. 


During my Phd, I discovered that I love coding as much as I love understanding human behavior from the data; so, I decided to learn more about data science where I can combine both. I took data science courses including machine learning at NYU to grow my skills and apply different techniques in my research. My research agenda involes using machine learning prediction techniques to identify biases in human decision making.
